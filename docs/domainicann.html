            <h1>How The Internet Works </h1>
            <p>
                The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN is a global body that coordinates domain
                names systems; IP addresses country codes, as well as other technical support services. This
                organization replaced the US government body, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, and now performs
                the functions of the predecessors.
                The main function of ICANN as explained in the ICANN website http://www.icann.org, is to coordinate the
                operations of the internet. In fact, without this coordination, we would not have one global internet,
                and that is why we are all able to find information from the internet, regardless of our localities and
                geographical spread.
                Some of the achievements of ICANN as outlined in the website include advancing competition that has led
                to the lowering of domain name costs by almost 80%.
                ICANN has also established a technical framework that is useful I resolving domain names disputes,
                additionally, ICANN has been instrumental in ensuring that domains names can be registered in over 100
                languages. Finally, together with other stakeholders, ICANN has been instrumental in the development of
                platforms that ensure internet security all over the world.
            </p>

                Domain names are unique identification names that are used on the internet websites. Its actually the
                root web address for a website. They enable one to retain their identity amongst millions of other
                names. When one buys and acquires a domain name, they are able to use it without fear of confusion with
                any other, as a domain name is unique and protected and there is no one else that has the same domain
                name in the world. It therefore gives the owner a unique identity on the internet.
                Registered domain names are those domain names that have already been assigned to a unique user. These
                have already been acquired and are not available for sale by the vendors. For instance, icann.org is a
                registered domain name and cannot be made available to any other users according to the rules. It
                identifies the owner of the address and is unique to that owner.
                Top level domain name is usually the last bit of the internet domain, normally, itâ€™s the last letters
                that follow the last and final dot in a domain name. For instance, yahoo.com, com is the top level
                domain.
